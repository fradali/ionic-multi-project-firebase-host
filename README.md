# How to create and config project

# 1- Create a workspace

ng new yourOwndirectory --createApplication=false
cd ./yourOwndirectory
 
# 2- Create our projects directory

mkdir projects

# 3- Add ionic.config.json to root Project

 fill it with : 
 ```
{
  "projects": {}
  } 
```
  
# 4- Create two ionic projects

cd ./projects
ionic start appOne blank
ionic start appTwo tabs

# 5- Avoid Configuration problems 

Now you have a projects folder with 2 Ionic projects, a good start so far. If you were to follow the official guide, it wouldnâ€™t work yet as the projects would not be found.

The reason is that the automatically generated angular.json file contains a generic app keyword, and we have to change it to match the name of our projects.

We need to change every angular.json :

  -- "defaultProject": "appOne"
  -- "projects": {  ->"appOne": {
  -- replace every app: by your name  which should be another 12 occurrences in the whole file.

  A final look at the root ionic.config.json shows that the apps were added:
  
 ```
{
  "projects": {
    "appOne": {
      "name": "appOne",
      "integrations": {},
      "type": "angular",
      "root": "projects/appOne"
    },
    "appTwo": {
      "name": "app",
      "integrations": {},
      "type": "angular",
      "root": "projects/appTwo"
    }
  }
}
```

# 6- Creating our Pwa 
Follow this link : https://ionicframework.com/docs/angular/pwa for every project (DO NOT DEPLOY TO FIREBASE)

# 7- Multi hosting Firebase

 1. install firebse tools : npm install -g firebase-tools
 2. cd root project
 3. run this cmd : firebase init hosting
 4. Now we just need to update the firebase.json hosting config. Each site has a target that points to the public deployable code in the www folder. ( Array of hosting object : duplicate the example in this url https://ionicframework.com/docs/angular/pwa#firebase and set a target for each application)
 5. Define Hosting Targets : 
 For this just run this cmd : firebase target:apply hosting 'appName' 'Name in firebase' (run it X times for X project)

# Firebase Deployment

Our configuration is complete. We can deploy all sites together with:

firebase deploy --only hosting
Or deploy a single site based on the target name:

firebase serve --only hosting:appOne
